# GRC Response Assistant: AI Solution for Utility Rate Case Management
Q1: How can we revolutionize how utility companies manage their General Rate Case (GRC) processes?
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

"I had the privilege of collaborating with Shawna Tuli over two quarters on an AI-powered Assistant to streamline General Rate Case processes. From our first weekly check-in, Shawna demonstrated an exceptional ability to distill complex technical concepts into clear, actionable guidance. Her quick communication skills ensured I never waited more than a few hours for feedback or answers—no matter how detailed my questions were.

Shawna’s commitment extended far beyond our scheduled meetings. She proactively reviewed drafts of our research paper, often outside of normal hours to ensure we met journal-ready standards. Her willingness to be available at all times and to go above and beyond weekly check-ins created an environment where I felt fully supported to take creative risks and grow as a computer scientist.

Beyond her technical expertise in building automated data pipelines, LLM integrations, and user-centric React interfaces, Shawna’s mentorship offered invaluable career insights. She generously shared her experiences at Accenture and within the broader tech consulting landscape, helping me better understand how to navigate both AI projects and professional growth.

I wholeheartedly recommend Shawna to anyone seeking not only an outstanding AI and cloud innovator, but also a mentor whose dedication, responsiveness, and genuine investment in her colleagues set her apart. She would be an asset to any team." - Rish Sharma (UCI ICS Computer Science Senior)

"Over the past four years, Shawna has been an outstanding partner to the UCI ICS Capstone Projects, consistently delivering impactful projects that connect academic and industry needs. In her role as a Data Science lead with Accenture, Shawna has gone above and beyond, mentoring our students and driving them to tackle real-world challenges with advanced AI solutions. Her leadership shines in fostering a collaborative environment where students feel empowered to contribute their unique strengths, resulting in solutions that not only address client needs but also drive tangible business outcomes.

Shawna's dedication to academic rigor has led her teams to publish their research across respected platforms, including UROP, NSF, and WJARR, adding a meaningful layer of scholarly achievement to the capstone experience. Her combination of technical expertise, hands-on guidance, and motivational leadership has made a significant and lasting impact on our UCI ICS students and the field of data science. I highly recommend Shawna for her visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to advancing innovation through collaboration." - Mimi Anderson (UCI ICS Capstone Projects Associate Director)
